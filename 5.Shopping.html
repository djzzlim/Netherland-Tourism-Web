            Wooden clogs are a classic Dutch gift dating back to the 1200s. Dutch locals don‚Äôt usually
            wear these
            traditional shoes, but this is a souvenir you should buy when traveling to the ‚ÄúLand of
            Tulips and
            Windmills‚Äù.
            You can easy find these pretty clogs in souvenir shops.<br>
            Perhaps wooden clogs are not really comfortable when walking, but you can completely use
            them for a
            different
            purpose. Today, Dutch wooden clogs are viewed mainly as souvenirs and decorations. For
            example, to decorate
            your
            house, use it as a paperweight (because wooden clogs are quite heavy even in mini sizes),
            more specifically,
            you
            can use these clogs to grow small trees or plants for the garden to make it more unique and
            strange.
