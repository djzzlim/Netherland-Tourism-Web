              Most likely, you'll be flying out of one of the five airports in the Netherlands.
              Maastricht,
              Rotterdam, Groningen, and Eindhoven are among the locations of these. Lelystad Airport in
              Flevoland
              is currently undergoing plans for expansion. However, Amsterdam Schiphol is by far the
              biggest
              airport in the Netherlands. Schiphol, one of Europe's busiest airports, is only a short
              train ride
              from the heart of Amsterdam and offers international flights.

              international
              passenger traffic is Schiphol. Roughly 25 million people accessed it in 2021, down from
              almost 72
              million in 2019. It serves the Greater Amsterdam area and is around 10 kilometres from
              Amsterdam. It
              boasts a lot of amenities, including dining establishments, shops, and even a spa.
              <br>
              Accessing Schiphol is simple and may be done via train or bus because to its close proximity
              to
              Amsterdam. Since Schiphol is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands, many locals will
              fly
              there and then take the train to get home. The airport features plenty of bicycle parking in
              addition to car parking.

                The <strong>OV-chipkaart</strong> (OV stands for openbaar vervoer, or public transport)
                is the Dutch
                smart-card payment
                system
                that operates across the country on all public transport options. There are two types of
                OV-chipkaart:
                <strong><em>anonymous</em></strong>
                and <strong><em>personal</em></strong>. Anonymous cards can be bought and topped up from
                machines and
                ticket offices at train and
                metro
                stations. Personal cards need to be purchased online, and you will need to provide a
                photo for the card.
                These
                cards can be topped up online or at a ticket machine. Alternatively, you can sign-up for
                automatic
                top-ups
                when
                your balance falls below a certain amount. Journey costs are determined by the distance
                of your journey
                and
                varies depending on the mode of transport. When you check in, a boarding fare is debited
                from your card.
                When
                you check out at your destination, you will be refunded this boarding fare, minus the
                charge for the
                kilometers
                you‚Äôve traveled. However, if you fail to check out, you will have to pay the whole
                boarding fare, up to
                ‚Ç¨20.

              streets without actually walking or cycling through them. The Netherlands' four main
              cities‚ÄîAmsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht‚Äîeach have their own tram system.
              Amsterdam has the largest network of these, with 500 tram stations spread across 15 lines.
              Trams are typically the quickest mode of public transit in the Netherlands for getting
              through congested city centres. They also serve as fantastic ways to experience the city,
              though. In fact, one of the top tram routes in the world, according to National Geographic,
              is Amsterdam's Tram 2. It begins at Centraal Station and highlights some of the top sights

              When considering public transportation, ferries might not be your first choice, but in the
              Netherlands, your closest one might be your best bet. Bicyclists and pedestrians can cross
              the IJ for free in Amsterdam. If you're seeking for an authentically Amsterdam experience,
              services are available 24/7. In the Netherlands, there are other types of ferries as well.
              Ferries that span rivers with pedestrians and bicycles are available on some rivers. Some
              require your own operation, while others are manned. Additionally, ferries run between the
              mainland and the northern islands, including Texel. If you're planning a bike trip in
              particular, check ahead to avoid disappointment since you might need to take a detour over
              the next bridge if the ferry isn't operating.
